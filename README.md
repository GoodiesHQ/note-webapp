# note-webapp

A simple web application front-end for the [Note server](https://github.com/GoodiesHQ/note-server/). The server simply stores notes as TEXT data.

The web app, however, provides [client-side encryption](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js) for the notes (AES-256 and encoded in base64 for transport over HTTP). ONLY the encrypted text is sent to the server. The password is generated by the web app and is irretrievable by the server. The user must therefore either:

 - copy the link with the password as a fragment
 - copy the link without the password and send it separateley over another form of communication

 
The password in the URL is base64 encoded (and URI-escaped) and passed as a URL fragment. These, of course, are [not transported over HTTP](https://blog.httpwatch.com/2011/03/01/6-things-you-should-know-about-fragment-urls/). Once the note has been retrieved by the web app, the user can input a password for decryption.


**Note**: This is my very first javascript application and meant to be a simple first project. I decided to use Vue because, as a framework, seems a fair bit simpler than angular, react, and other competitors right at the outset, but is also extensible and intuitively managed.
